# Leads Dashboard

Welcome to my Leads Dashboard. This application was built to showcase my technical skills using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces
- **Tailwind**: A utility-first CSS framework for building modern, responsive user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web applications.
- **Vercel**: A platform for deploying fast, modern web applications.
